    QUICK START
==========================================================================================
     Below is set of steps to edit, compile and run simulations

==========================================================================================
    - COMPILE AND RUN

      Code is parallelized through MPI so mpi compiler is needed. Compile the code via

         mpif90 params.f90 global_vars.f90 merstwist.f90 sorting.f90 functions.f90 nlist.f90 grow.f90 divide.f90 movie.f90 embryo_model.f90

      * Order is important since some of the modules are used in other source files.
      ** Source files are params.f90 global_vars.f90 merstwist.f90 sorting.f90 functions.f90 nlist.f90 grow.f90 divide.f90 movie.f90 and main: embryo_model.f90
      *** Optional input is writecont file which contains initial configuration of the system. Flag indicating there is an input file is hard coded in common.f90->readcont. 
See Modules below for details.


      Run code via 
          
          mpirun -n 8 ./a.out 
 
      This will run code with 8 processes. Number of processes is hardcoded in common.f90->iter (2^inter = number of processes). See Modules below for details.


==========================================================================================
 - LIST OF OUTPUT FILES

   List of desired output files is controlled by following flags defined in common.f90
     - writecont: 
           record configuration of the system. output is “writecont” file which later can be used and input configuration file for simulations.
     - wr_node: 
           record node positions along AP and lateral axis with stds. output is “nodcord” file which is used in node.m analyzer scrip.
     - wr_dens: 
           record cell number density at specific time steps. output is “densxxx” files which is used in density movies and number_density analyzer scripts.
     - wr_border: 
           record cell lateral borders. output is “borders” file. DEPRECATED
     - wr_traj: 
           record cells positions at specific time steps. output is “stat” file which is used in various analyzer scripts such as MSD, trajectories etc. Also used to generate trajectory movies.
     - wr_ncell: 
           record number of anterior and posterior cells in the system. output is “ncell” file used in cell_number analyzer scripts
     - wr_psfil: 
           record file that later translates into simulation movie. output is “psfil” postscript file used in movie.pl analyzer script.



 - OUPUT FILE FORMATS:
       
      “writecont”:

            X1   Y1   R1
            ..   ..   ..
            XN   YN   RN
        
       X, Y are AP and lateral positions of cell. R is its hard core radius, 1, 2, … N spans number of cells in system
 

      “nodcord”: 

           TIME    X    STD_X    Y    STD_Y
           …
 
       TIME is time step. X, Y are AP and lateral positions of node. Node positions are recorded each 1000 timsteps. STD_X and STD_Y denote standard deviation of the node’s position over those 1000 steps.



       “ncell”:

           TIME    N_ANTERIOR    N_POSTERIOR
           …

       TIME is time step. N_ANTERIOR and N_POSTERIOR are number of anterior and posterior cells in the system.


       “densXXX”

          MIN_X     MIN_Y   N_GRID_X    N_GRID_Y
          GRID_I    GRID_J  N_CELLS
          …

       First line is the minimum of X,Y coordinates (the lower left border point of the system, needed for grid subdivision of the system) and number of cell grids in X and Y directions
       Second and the rest of the lines loop over grid cells (grid indices) and show total number of simulated cells in the given grid cell.


       “stat”:

         TIME    ID    X    Y    X_NODE    Y_NODE
         …
         
        TIME is the time step, ID is the cell id, (X, Y) are cell’s coordinates, (X_NODE, Y_NODE) are node’s coordinates at given time step.



        “psfil”. 
           
           Postscript file which which plots circles for cells centred at (X, Y) and with hard and soft radii (R, DELTA).

- LIST OF MODULES WITH CORRESPONDING CRUCIAL FUNCTIONALITY


    *params*: module of simulation parameters.
    
        Sets following properties of the system
           - number of processors for parallelization
           - cell characteristics such as cell radii, cell-cell interaction parameters
           - system borders (AP and lateral)
           - what outputs should be produced? described above.

   *global_vars*: module of variables shared across processors
   
   *nlist*: module to generate neighbour lists for fast integration as well as calculate cell number density
        
       Sets following properties of the system
          - cell-cell interaction cutoff distances as well as number density cutoffs are set here.

   *divide*: module performes division of a parent cell. 

   *grow*: module for cell growth
       
       Sets following properties of the system
          - cell contact mediated suppression of the growth (*dens_upper_0* and *dens_upper_1* for anterior and posterior cells)
         - growth rate of individual cell gr0



   *functions*: module for various useful function. list below reflects only ones that are needed to submit new set of simulations. more info is in the comments of the code itself


        - assign_cell_type: 
            - defines cell types based on their relative position from the node. 
            - this is the part of the code that defines wild type, LOF and GOF types of simulations.

        - diffc: 
            - defines the diffusion coefficient for a given cell based on its type and the number of nearest neighbours. Change this part if difference diffusion behaviour is desired.

       - calc_f:
           - calculates cell-cell interaction forces based on elastic spring forces. Change interaction forces here if desired. 
           The softness of well walls is set here.

        *** other functions are related to the allocation of data arrays, and dat communication between different processes  


 

   *embryo_model*: main module.

           -read input files and writes outputs.
